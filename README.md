# Tool-Status-Dashboard-VBA-based-
The dashboard that was built in VBA, shows the actual status of all FE tools in production. Every tool or module that change its status (by operator) creates auto message in outlook and sends to the relevant folks/owner. In addition by clicking each tool button takes to filling daily checks relevant to each tool, and the specification documents.




**Specification Document – FE Tool Status Dashboard (VBA-based)**


**1. Objective: ** 
To provide a real-time monitoring and control solution for FE (Front-End) production tools, including automated status notifications, traceability, and access to daily tool check forms and specifications.

**2. General Description:**  
The dashboard, developed using VBA within Excel, visually displays the current status of all production tools and modules. It enables automated communication, traceability, and structured data management.

**3. Main Functionalities:**

- Live Tool Status Display:  
  A dynamic interface showing the current operational status of each tool or module.

- Automated Email Notifications: *
  Any change in tool status triggered by the operator generates and sends an automatic Outlook message to the relevant stakeholders (e.g., tool owner, maintenance, production etc.).

- Tool-Specific Daily Checks:  
  Clicking a tool button directs the user to a dedicated form for completing and logging daily check parameters.

- Access to Specification Documents:  
  Each tool is linked to its respective SOPs and specification files for immediate reference.

- Data Logging:
All tool status changes, operator actions, and daily check inputs are logged in a structured format for future reference and analysis.

- Traceability & Data Validation:
  Built-in logic ensures that user inputs are validated (e.g., required fields, value ranges) and that each action is traceable by time, user, and tool. This supports compliance and quality control.

**4. Key Benefits:**

- Real-time visibility and control.  
- Improved communication and response time.  
- Full traceability of tool usage and operator activity.  
- Robust data collection for performance and maintenance analysis.  
- Ensures consistent compliance with operational standards.

**5. Technical Requirements:**

- Microsoft Excel with VBA enabled.  
- Microsoft Outlook for email automation.  
- Access to network locations for documentation and log storage.

**6. Target Users:**

Production Operators+Leaders, Equipment and Process Engineers, Shift Managers.
